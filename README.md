# Short-Axiom-Searching
 
Made by Matthew Walsh with the help of Branden Fitelson, Northeastern University.

Used to prove that Meredith's 21-symbol single axiom of classical sentential logic is the shortest possible, in addition to finding other axioms of length 21.

Used to prove that Meredith's 19-symbol single axioms of classical sentential logic with the fulsum operator are the shortest possible, in addition to finding other axioms of length 19.
