Examples for running the first half, the generation of all tautologies of a specific length can be found in Examples.ipynb

Examples for running the second half, the generation of counter models for tautologies, can also be found in Examples.ipynb. Notably, in general the settings used for vampire were:
"--mode casc_sat -t 240 --fmb_start_size 2" 
Sometimes t was 600, 1000, or 2000.

Functions in VampireHandler.py are still being tested as of 11/29/21
